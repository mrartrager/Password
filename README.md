# Challenge 3
## Password Generator

## Desciption 
I had an equally good and frustrating time building this password generator. After a lot of trial and erroring, I was finally able to figure out how the for loop works
that was needed to create the password. I had the for loop written out correctly, just figuring out what to "fill" the for loop woth was the biggest struggle for me. I
I was very surprised by how much JavaScript starts to make sense when you just work with it more. at the start of this project I was very intimidated by JavaScript, and
By the end of the project I was still intimidated by it, but I understood way more.


## Installation
 
N/A
 
## Usage
 
Usage for the password generator is fairly straightforward. Just click on the Generate Password button, this will cause a few prompts to show up that you'll have to answer.
The prompts are just there to ask the user what they want their password to consist of, and how long the password will be as well. Make sure you choose a number between 8
and 128 characters, or else you'll be prompted to start over and choose the correct number. I also added some things to the console.log nothing to crazy but if a user decides
that they don't want numbers in their password for example, in the console log a message in red will make sure the user is aware that their password will not have numbers.
But this idea works for every prompt the user says no to in the console.log.
Once a user works through the prompts they will be given a random generated password based on the prompts they chose. The password is also logged in the console log as well.
