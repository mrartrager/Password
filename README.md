## Password Generator

## Desciption 
    I had a equally good and frustrating time building this password generator. After a lot of trial and erroring, I was finally able to figure out how the for loop works 
    that was needed to created the password. I had the for loop written out correctly, just figuring out what to "fil" the for loop woth was the biggest struggle for me. I 
    was very surprised by how much JavaScript starts to make sense when you just work with it more. at the start of this project I was very intimidated by JavaScript, and 
    by then end of the project I was still intimidated by it, but I understood way more. 
## Installation
 
N/A
 
## Usage
 
Usage for the password generator is failry straight foward. Just click on the Generate Password button, this will casue a few promts to show up that youll have to answer. 
The prompts are just there to ask the user what they want their password to consist of, and how long the password will be as well. Make sure you choose a number between 8
 and 128 characters, or else you'll be promt to start over and choose the correct number. I also added some things to the console.log nothing to crazy but if a user decides
 that they don't want numbers in their password for example, in the console log a message in red will make sure the user is aware that thier password will not have numbers.
 But this idea works for every promt the user says no to in the console.log. 

 Once a user works through the promts they will be given a random generated password based off the promts they chose. The password is also logged in the console log as well.
